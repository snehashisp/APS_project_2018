The code for various components are given in their respective files i.e 
vEB-Trees in van_emde.h,van_emde.cpp
binomial heap in Binomial-heap.h,Binomial-heap.cpp
fibonacci heap in fibonacci.h,fibonacci.cpp

node.h,node.cpp has a generic node structure used to represent a graph node. 

make will create a binary called main
to run code in normal mode call ./main
Then give the data for the graph in the following format 

nodes edges
node1 node2 weight_of_edge_between_them
node2 node3 weight
.
.
.
node(n) node(k) weight
source_vertex vEB_tree_universe

this will give the output as a vector of distances from the source node to all other nodes 
in the three trees provided as well as the execution duration of each code
